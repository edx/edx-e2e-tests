testedx-e2e-tests
=============

End-to-end tests for edX applications.

Overview
--------

UI-level tests for edX applications:

- ``pages``: PageObjects for interacting with pages under test.
- ``e2e_test``: Bokchoy tests for the Learning Management System (LMS) and Studio.


Installation
------------

You will also need a deployed installation of edX lms and studio to run the tests against.
See `edx/configuration <http://github.com/edx/configuration>`_ for instructions on provisioning an edX instance.
For additional information on how to setup your development environment, see `Developer Onboarding <https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=ENG&title=Developer+Onboarding#DeveloperOnboarding-Step4:Getreadytodevelop>`_

Devstack
--------

If you are running against devstack you are in luck! E2E test functionality is built-in and you can run it using the
``make e2e-tests`` make command from the ``devstack`` directory.

Using Docker
------------

1. Clone the repo:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/edx/edx-e2e-tests

2. Share your directory:

Make sure your edx-e2e-tests directory is shared in Docker settings or the next step will fail

3. Build up:

.. code:: bash

    docker-compose up --build

4. Open a new terminal window and work inside the container:

.. code:: bash

    docker exec -it edxe2etests /bin/bash

5. Set the environment variables:

You will need to configure the target environment that you want to run tests against. There is an example file that
has all of the environment variables that need to be exported. Copy local_env.sh.sample to a new file and update the
variables as necessary. Once done, source the file to get all of the variables into your environment.

6. Run lms and studio tests, as given below in 'How to run LMS and Studio tests' section

7. In OSX at least (not sure about other host systems) you can VNC in with the following (the password is 'secret'):

.. code:: bash

    open vnc://localhost:35900

Configuration
-------------

1. Before running the commands change your working directory to `edx-e2e-tests`. Note that
   the 'e2e' python virtual environment will automatically be activated.

.. code:: bash

    cd edx-e2e-tests/

2. Update the base python requirements in case they have changed
   since you created the environment:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -r requirements/base.txt

3. OPTIONAL: Cloning the edx-platform repo into a mounted directory in a docker environment
   can take a long time (several minutes). An alternative is to navigate to the lib directory
   back on your host system and clone the edx-platform repo there before proceeding.

4. Install the page objects for the application from the edx platform repo. This will
   clone the entire repo into lib/edx-platform so that it can use the page objects and
   helper methods from common/test/acceptance. We also install capa and xmodule into the
   virtual environment from common/lib.


.. code:: bash

    paver install_pages


How to run LMS and Studio tests
--------------------------------

Before running tests, please ensure that following environment variables are set.

.. code:: bash

    ==> BASIC_AUTH_USER
    ==> BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD
    ==> USER_LOGIN_EMAIL
    ==> USER_LOGIN_PASSWORD
    ==> COURSE_RUN
    ==> COURSE_DISPLAY_NAME
    ==> COURSE_NUMBER
    ==> COURSE_ORG

To run all the tests:

.. code:: bash

    paver e2e_test --exclude=whitelabel


The commands also accept nose-style specifiers for test case or module:

To run all the tests in the file:

.. code:: bash

    paver e2e_test lms/test_dashboard.py

To run all the tests in a particular class:

.. code:: bash

    paver e2e_test lms/test_dashboard.py:DashboardTest

To run a single test:

.. code:: bash

    paver e2e_test lms/test_dashboard.py:DashboardTest.test_resume_course


To update page objects installed from external repos:

.. code:: bash

    paver install_pages


How to run Whitelabel tests
----------------------------

Before running whitelabel tests please ensure that these environment variables are set.

.. code:: bash

    ==> BASIC_AUTH_USER
    ==> BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD
    ==> USER_LOGIN_EMAIL
    ==> USER_LOGIN_PASSWORD
    ==> COURSE_RUN
    ==> COURSE_DISPLAY_NAME
    ==> COURSE_NUMBER
    ==> COURSE_ORG
    ==> GLOBAL_PASSWORD
    ==> STAFF_USER_EMAIL
    ==> TEST_EMAIL_SERVICE
    ==> TEST_EMAIL_ACCOUNT
    ==> TEST_EMAIL_PASSWORD
    ==> ACCESS_TOKEN


To run all the tests in the file:

.. code:: bash

    paver e2e_wl_test whitelabel/test_user_account.py

NOTE: In order to run tests in a particular class or a single test, use the same Nose specifiers as mentioned in the above section. However, do not forget to change the paver target to e2e_wl_test


Where and How to add new tests
-------------------------------

Change your working directory to `regression/tests`. Add your tests to the below mentioned directories based on the relevancy of the tests.

    1. `lms`: tests for the LMS pages
    2. `studio`: tests for the studio pages
    3. `whitelabel`: tests for microsites
    4. `helpers`: helper methods for the tests
    5. `common`: tests required for common components of lms and studio

NOTE: Please make a pull request from the master branch before writing and adding new tests.


How to change target environment?
---------------------------------

Studio and LMS urls for stage are ``https://studio.stage.edx.org``
and ``https://courses.stage.edx.org`` respectively. We don't need to
do anything extra to run tests on the stage. By default, all tests
run on the stage.

If we want to change this behaviour then we would need to set
environment variables to point to our desired environment.
To be specific, we would need to set

1. For studio, ``STUDIO_BASE_URL`` which defaults to ``studio.stage.edx.org`` and

2. For LMS, ``LMS_BASE_URL`` which defaults to ``courses.stage.edx.org``.

Lets say we want to run tests on a sandbox which has studio and LMS urls as ``https://studio.sandbox.edx.org``
and ``https://lms.sandbox.edx.org`` respectively. To let repo know, set environment variables as

.. code:: bash

    export STUDIO_BASE_URL=studio.sandbox.edx.org
    export LMS_BASE_URL=lms.sandbox.edx.org

Depending on the target environment you may also need to change ``LMS_PROTOCOL`` and ``STUDIO_PROTOCOL`` to ``http`` or
``https``.

To run tests back on stage, unset the above set environment variables.

.. code:: bash

    unset STUDIO_BASE_URL
    unset LMS_BASE_URL
